# Collaborative Features Setup Guide

## Overview

N8tive.io Project Manager now supports **team collaboration** features, allowing users to:
- Create and manage teams
- Invite members with role-based permissions
- Share tasks across teams
- Switch between personal and team workspaces

---

## Database Setup

### 1. Run the Teams Schema Migration

Connect to your MySQL database and run the migration:

```bash
mysql -h your-rds-endpoint.rds.amazonaws.com -u your_username -p your_database < backend/teams-schema.sql
```

Or execute directly via SSH on EC2:

```bash
ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@your-ec2-ip
cd ~/Project-Manager/backend
mysql -h your-rds-endpoint -u your_username -p your_database < teams-schema.sql
```

This creates 4 new tables:
- `teams` - Team/project information
- `team_members` - User memberships with roles
- `team_invitations` - Pending invitations (future use)
- Updates `tasks` table with `team_id` column

---

## Backend API Endpoints

### Team Management

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/teams` | Get all teams for current user |
| POST | `/api/teams` | Create new team |
| GET | `/api/teams/:id` | Get team details |
| DELETE | `/api/teams/:id` | Delete team (owner only) |

### Team Members

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/teams/:id/members` | Get team members |
| POST | `/api/teams/:id/invite` | Invite user to team |
| PUT | `/api/teams/:id/members/:userId` | Update member role |
| DELETE | `/api/teams/:id/members/:userId` | Remove member |
| POST | `/api/teams/:id/leave` | Leave team |

### Task Sharing

Tasks now support a `team_id` field:
- When creating a task, optionally include `teamId` in the request body
- Tasks without `team_id` are personal tasks
- Tasks with `team_id` are visible to all team members

**Example:**
```javascript
// Create personal task
POST /api/tasks
{
  "title": "My Task",
  "status": "todo",
  "priority": "med"
}

// Create team task
POST /api/tasks
{
  "title": "Team Task",
  "status": "todo",
  "priority": "high",
  "teamId": 1
}
```

## User Roles

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full control: manage members, edit team, delete team |
| **Admin** | Manage members, invite users |
| **Member** | Create/edit/delete team tasks |
| **Viewer** | View team tasks only |

## Frontend Features

### Task Assignment

When creating a task:
